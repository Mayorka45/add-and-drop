This Python project automates the process of checking seat availability for courses at AUI 🎓 and sends an email notification 📧 when a seat becomes available in a selected section. It uses Selenium for web scraping and smtplib for email notifications.

#Features 🚀
Web Scraping: Uses Selenium to scrape course section information and check for available seats 🔍.
Email Notification: Sends an email to the user when a seat becomes available in the selected course section(s) 📩.
User Input: The user selects which course sections they are interested in (from 1 to 4) 📝.
Continuous Monitoring: The script continuously checks for seat availability and sends a notification when a spot is free 🔄.
#Requirements 🛠️
Python 3.x 🐍
Selenium library
smtplib for email sending
A Chrome WebDriver for Selenium 🖥️
Internet connection 🌐
#Installation ⚙️
Install Python 3.x from the official website: Python Downloads.

Install Selenium:

bash
Copier
Modifier
pip install selenium
Download the ChromeDriver for Selenium (Ensure it matches your Chrome browser version).

Place chromedriver.exe in a folder, and update the chrome_driver_path in the code to match your local path.

#Usage 🏃‍♂️
Start the Script: Run the Python script after ensuring all dependencies are installed and the chrome_driver_path is correctly set.

Select Sections: When prompted, enter the section numbers you're interested in (from 1 to 4). For example:

css
Copier
Modifier
Enter the section you are interested in numbers from 1 to 4: 1 3
The script will monitor the selected sections for seat availability 🎯.

Email Notification: If a seat becomes available in one of the selected sections, an email will be sent to the provided email address with the course and section details 📧.

#Code Walkthrough 🔍
Selenium Setup: The script uses the Selenium WebDriver to open the AUI course schedules page and fetch data for each section 🖥️.

Email Sending: The send_email() function sends an email using the smtplib library whenever a seat becomes available 📤.

Seat Availability Check: The check_seat_availability() function scrapes each section (from 1 to 4) to check if there are available seats 🏫.

User Input: The script asks the user to select which sections to monitor. The script then checks availability for the selected sections ⚡.

Looping & Sleeping: The script waits 60 seconds before starting and continues to monitor the selected sections at 10-second intervals ⏳ until a seat is found.

#Example Email ✉️
When a seat becomes available, an email with the following subject and body is sent to the specified recipient:

Subject: Seat Available for [Course Code]
Body: Seats available for [Course Code]: [Section Info]
#Customization 🔧
Email Address: The email sender and receiver addresses are hardcoded. Modify them to suit your needs 💌.
Course URL: Modify the url variable if the course schedule link changes or if you're scraping a different webpage 🌐.
Section XPath: If the HTML structure changes, you may need to update the XPaths for the course sections 🔄.
